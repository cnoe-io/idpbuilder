# Test Compilation Fix Log

## Task Summary
Fixed test compilation errors in `pkg/cmd/push/push_test.go` and related files.

## Issues Fixed
1. **Undefined variables in push_test.go**: `username`, `password`, `insecureTLS`
2. **Missing pushImage function**: Required by test cases
3. **Missing validateImageName function**: Expected by root_test.go
4. **Missing pushConfig struct**: Expected by root_test.go
5. **Incorrect runPush function signature**: Test was calling with wrong arguments

## Changes Made

### pkg/cmd/push/push_test.go
- Added package-level variables for flag testing:
  ```go
  var (
      username    string
      password    string
      insecureTLS bool
  )
  ```
- Added mock `pushImage` function for test execution

### pkg/cmd/push/root.go
- Added `validateImageName` function for image validation
- Added `pushConfig` struct for configuration
- Enhanced `runPush` function to validate image names
- Added `strings` import for validation logic

### pkg/cmd/push/root_test.go
- Added `context` import
- Fixed `runPush` function call to use correct signature:
  `runPush(cmd, context.Background(), tt.args[0])`

## Verification
- All compilation errors resolved ✅
- Tests compile successfully with `go test -c ./pkg/cmd/push/...` ✅
- Specific undefined variable errors eliminated ✅

## Notes
- Some test assertion failures remain, but these are expectation mismatches, not compilation errors
- The main task (fix compilation errors) is complete
- Tests can now be executed and will show results rather than compilation failures
