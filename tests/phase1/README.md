# Phase 1 Test Implementations

Test implementations will be created here by SW Engineers during development.

## Test Plan Reference

The Phase 1 test plan is located in the planning repository:
- `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/planning/phase1/PHASE-1-TEST-PLAN.md`

## Directory Purpose

This directory will contain:
- Unit tests for Phase 1 components
- Integration tests for Phase 1 features
- Test harness scripts (PHASE-TEST-HARNESS.sh)

## R342 Compliance

This directory was created as part of early integration branch creation (R342).
Tests will be added during implementation to maintain TDD compliance (R341).
