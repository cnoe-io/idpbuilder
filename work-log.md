# Work Log: effort-1.1.2-auth-flags
Phase 1 Wave 1 - Authentication Flags

## Started: 2025-09-26T01:26:40Z

## Session 2: Code Reviewer - EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION
**Start Time**: 2025-09-26 01:43:14 UTC
**Agent**: Code Reviewer

### Activities Completed

1. **Pre-flight Checks** ✅
   - Verified working directory: `/home/vscode/workspaces/idpbuilder-gitea-push/efforts/phase1/wave1/effort-1.1.2-auth-flags`
   - Confirmed git branch: `phase1-wave1-effort-1.1.2-auth-flags`
   - Validated git repository exists
   - Checked remote configuration

2. **Plan Analysis** ✅
   - Read master implementation plan from project root
   - Analyzed authentication requirements from Phase 1, Wave 1.1
   - Identified scope: --username and --password flags with validation

3. **Effort Plan Creation** ✅
   - Created comprehensive EFFORT-PLAN.md
   - Defined file structure (4 main implementation files, ~250 lines total)
   - Documented 5 implementation steps
   - Specified test requirements (85% coverage target)
   - Added success criteria and risk mitigation

### Key Decisions

1. **Architecture**: Separated concerns into three packages:
   - `pkg/auth/types.go`: Core types and interfaces (~30 lines)
   - `pkg/auth/flags.go`: Flag definitions and parsing (~70 lines)
   - `pkg/auth/validator.go`: Validation logic (~50 lines)
   - `cmd/push.go`: Integration with command (~80 lines)

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - No credential logging in any output
   - Clear sensitive data after use
   - Input validation to prevent injection attacks

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration test stubs only (actual integration in Phase 2)
   - Focus on validation and flag parsing

### Files Created
- `EFFORT-PLAN.md`: Complete implementation plan for authentication flags

### Size Estimates
- Total effort: ~250 lines
- Well under the 800-line limit
- Breakdown:
  - Core implementation: ~230 lines
  - Initial unit tests: ~20 lines

### Next Steps
1. Commit and push EFFORT-PLAN.md to branch
2. Plan will be used by Software Engineer for implementation
3. Code review will follow after implementation
