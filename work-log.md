### Tasks Completed

1. **Analyzed Master Implementation Plan**
   - Reviewed Phase 1, Wave 1 requirements
   - Identified effort 1.1.1 scope: Basic push command skeleton
   - Target size: ~350 lines

2. **Created EFFORT-PLAN.md**
   - Comprehensive implementation plan with all required sections
   - File structure defined (4 files)
   - Detailed implementation steps provided
   - Test requirements specified (90% coverage)
   - Integration points documented

3. **Key Planning Decisions**
   - Keep skeleton minimal - no actual push logic
   - Use existing cobra framework only
   - Test-first development approach
   - Clear boundaries with efforts 1.1.2 and 1.1.3
