# Work Log: effort-1.1.1-push-command-skeleton
Phase 1 Wave 1 - Push Command Skeleton

## Started: 2025-09-26T01:26:31Z

## Planning Phase Completed: 2025-09-26T01:45:00Z
**Agent**: Code Reviewer
**State**: EFFORT_PLAN_CREATION

### Tasks Completed

1. **Analyzed Master Implementation Plan**
   - Reviewed Phase 1, Wave 1 requirements
   - Identified effort 1.1.1 scope: Basic push command skeleton
   - Target size: ~350 lines

2. **Created EFFORT-PLAN.md**
   - Comprehensive implementation plan with all required sections
   - File structure defined (4 files)
   - Detailed implementation steps provided
   - Test requirements specified (90% coverage)
   - Integration points documented

3. **Key Planning Decisions**
   - Keep skeleton minimal - no actual push logic
   - Use existing cobra framework only
   - Test-first development approach
   - Clear boundaries with efforts 1.1.2 and 1.1.3

### Files to be Created/Modified
1. `cmd/push.go` - New push command (~200 lines)
2. `cmd/push_test.go` - Command tests (~100 lines)
3. `docs/push-help.txt` - Help documentation (~40 lines)
4. `cmd/root.go` - Register command (~10 lines modification)

### Ready for Implementation
Plan is complete and ready for SW Engineer to implement

## Implementation Phase Completed: 2025-09-26T01:55:00Z
**Agent**: Software Engineer
**State**: IMPLEMENTATION

### Implementation Tasks Completed

1. **Created Push Command Structure**
   - Created `pkg/cmd/push/root.go` with cobra command structure
   - Implemented basic image name validation
   - Added placeholder for future auth and TLS flags
   - Command prints status message (temporary until Phase 4 implementation)

2. **Registered Command in Root**
   - Modified `pkg/cmd/root.go` to import push package
   - Added push command to root command registration

3. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Created `pkg/cmd/push/root_test.go` with 100% test coverage
   - Tests cover: argument validation, image name validation, help display
   - All tests passing with excellent coverage

4. **Created Documentation**
   - Created `docs/push-help.txt` with comprehensive usage documentation
   - Includes examples, flags, exit codes, and future enhancement notes

### Implementation Metrics
- **Lines Implemented**: 73 implementation lines (measured by line-counter.sh)
- **Test Coverage**: 100% of statements
- **Size Compliance**: Well under 350 line estimate, far below 800 line limit
- **Files Created**: 3 new files, 1 modified
- **Tests Status**: All tests passing

### Code Quality
- Follows existing IDPBuilder cobra patterns
- Proper error handling with error wrapping
- Clear separation of concerns
- Ready for extension by efforts 1.1.2 and 1.1.3
- Clean commit messages

### Integration Points Ready
- Command appears in `idpbuilder --help` output
- Ready for auth flags (effort 1.1.2)
- Ready for TLS flags (effort 1.1.3)
- Ready for actual push implementation (Phase 4)

### Status: READY FOR REVIEW
