# Phase 1 Integration Merge Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive merge plan for integrating all Phase 1 wave branches into the `phase1-integration` branch. Phase 1 establishes the foundation and contracts for the idpbuilder-gitea-push project.

**Created By**: Code Reviewer Agent
**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Target Branch**: `phase1-integration`
**Current Status**: Branch already based on phase1-wave2-integration (latest wave)

## Phase 1 Summary
- **Total Efforts**: 5 (3 in Wave 1, 2 in Wave 2)
- **Total Implementation Lines**: 1,084 (537 + 547)
- **Foundation Components**:
  - Command skeleton and structure
  - Authentication flags and validation
  - TLS configuration
  - Test fixtures setup
  - Command testing framework

## Source Branches

### Wave 1: Foundation Layer (537 lines)
- **Branch**: `phase1-wave1-integration`
- **Efforts Included**:
  1. effort-1.1.1: Command skeleton setup
  2. effort-1.1.2: Authentication flags
  3. effort-1.1.3: TLS configuration
- **Status**: Fully integrated

### Wave 2: Testing Framework (547 lines)
- **Branch**: `phase1-wave2-integration`
- **Efforts Included**:
  1. effort-1.2.1: Test fixtures setup
  2. effort-1.2.2: Command testing framework
- **Status**: Fully integrated

## Merge Sequence

### Current State Analysis
The `phase1-integration` branch is already at commit `4d81a41`, which is the HEAD of `phase1-wave2-integration`. This indicates:
1. Wave 1 has been merged into Wave 2
2. Wave 2 is the latest integration point
3. Phase 1 integration is technically complete

### Verification Steps (DO NOT EXECUTE)

#### Step 1: Verify Branch Relationships
```bash
# Check that phase1-integration contains all wave commits
git log --oneline phase1-integration | grep -E "wave[12]"

# Verify all efforts are present
git log --oneline phase1-integration | grep -E "effort-1\.[12]\.[123]"

# Check merge commits
git log --merges --oneline phase1-integration
```

#### Step 2: Validate Content Integrity
```bash
# List all implementation files
find . -type f -name "*.go" | grep -v "_test.go" | sort

# Count total implementation lines
find . -name "*.go" -not -name "*_test.go" | xargs wc -l

# Verify package structure
ls -la pkg/
ls -la cmd/
```

## Pre-merge Checks

### 1. Branch Status Validation
```bash
# Ensure clean working tree
git status --porcelain

# Verify no uncommitted changes
test -z "$(git status --porcelain)" && echo "✅ Clean" || echo "❌ Uncommitted changes"

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current | grep -q "phase1-integration" && echo "✅ On correct branch"
```

### 2. Dependency Verification
```bash
# Check go.mod exists and is valid
go mod verify

# Ensure all dependencies are downloaded
go mod download

# Validate module structure
go list ./...
```

### 3. Build Validation
```bash
# Attempt to build the project
go build ./cmd/gitea-push

# Run static analysis
go vet ./...

# Check for compilation errors
go build -o /tmp/test-build ./cmd/gitea-push && rm /tmp/test-build
```

## Merge Commands (DO NOT EXECUTE - DOCUMENTATION ONLY)

Since phase1-integration is already at the latest wave integration commit, no additional merges are required. However, here are the commands that WOULD be used if merging was needed:

### Standard Merge Process
```bash
# 1. Ensure on target branch
git checkout phase1-integration

# 2. Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# 3. Merge Wave 1 (if not already merged)
git merge origin/phase1-wave1-integration --no-ff \
  -m "feat(phase1): Integrate Wave 1 - Foundation Layer (3 efforts, 537 lines)"

# 4. Merge Wave 2 (if not already merged)
git merge origin/phase1-wave2-integration --no-ff \
  -m "feat(phase1): Integrate Wave 2 - Testing Framework (2 efforts, 547 lines)"

# 5. Push integration branch
git push origin phase1-integration
```

### Fast-Forward Alternative (when applicable)
```bash
# If phase1-integration can be fast-forwarded to wave2
git checkout phase1-integration
git merge --ff-only origin/phase1-wave2-integration
git push origin phase1-integration
```

## Conflict Detection

### Automated Conflict Check
```bash
# Dry-run merge to detect conflicts
git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/phase1-wave2-integration
git merge --abort

# Check for potential conflicts
git diff phase1-integration origin/phase1-wave2-integration --name-only

# Identify conflicting files
for branch in phase1-wave1-integration phase1-wave2-integration; do
  echo "Checking $branch..."
  git diff phase1-integration origin/$branch --name-status
done
```

### Common Conflict Areas
1. **go.mod/go.sum**: Dependency version conflicts
2. **cmd/gitea-push/main.go**: Command initialization conflicts
3. **pkg/push/push.go**: Core logic modifications
4. **Test files**: Overlapping test utilities

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
```bash
# For go.mod conflicts
go mod tidy
go mod verify

# For code conflicts - preserve both functionalities
# 1. Keep authentication from Wave 1
# 2. Keep TLS config from Wave 1
# 3. Add testing framework from Wave 2
# 4. Ensure all imports are present
```

## Post-merge Validation

### 1. Build Verification
```bash
# Clean build
go clean -cache
go build -v ./cmd/gitea-push

# Run all tests
go test ./... -v

# Check test coverage
go test ./... -cover
```

### 2. Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration test suite
go test ./test/integration/... -v

# Verify command functionality
./gitea-push --help
./gitea-push --version

# Test with dry-run
./gitea-push --dry-run --config test-config.yaml
```

### 3. Line Count Verification
```bash
# Use official line counter tool
$PROJECT_ROOT/tools/line-counter.sh

# Verify total matches expected (1084 lines)
# Wave 1: 537 lines
# Wave 2: 547 lines
```

### 4. Effort Completeness Check
```bash
# Verify all effort markers present
git log --oneline | grep "marker: implementation complete" | wc -l
# Expected: 5 markers (one per effort)

# Check all efforts integrated
for effort in 1.1.1 1.1.2 1.1.3 1.2.1 1.2.2; do
  git log --oneline | grep -q "effort-$effort" && echo "✅ Effort $effort present"
done
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Complete Rollback
```bash
# Save current state
git tag phase1-integration-backup

# Reset to pre-merge state
git reset --hard origin/main

# Or reset to specific commit before merges
git reset --hard <commit-before-merges>

# Force push if needed (DANGEROUS)
git push --force-with-lease origin phase1-integration
```

### Partial Rollback (Revert Specific Merge)
```bash
# Find merge commit
git log --merges --oneline

# Revert specific merge
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

# Create revert commit
git commit -m "revert: Remove Wave X integration due to issues"
```

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Tag before operations**: `git tag pre-merge-$(date +%Y%m%d)`
2. **Backup branch**: `git branch phase1-integration-backup`
3. **Document issues**: Create MERGE-ISSUES.md if problems occur
4. **Notify team**: Update orchestrator state with rollback status

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Integration is successful when:
- ✅ All 5 efforts are present in commit history
- ✅ Total implementation lines = 1,084 (±50 for formatting)
- ✅ Project builds without errors
- ✅ All tests pass (unit + integration)
- ✅ Command executes with --help flag
- ✅ No merge conflicts remain
- ✅ go.mod is clean and verified

## Next Steps

After successful Phase 1 integration:
1. **Tag Release**: `git tag phase1-complete`
2. **Update Orchestrator State**: Mark phase1_status as "INTEGRATED"
3. **Architect Review**: Request architecture validation
4. **Prepare Phase 2**: Initialize Phase 2 planning
5. **Documentation**: Update PROJECT-STATUS.md

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks:
1. **Dependency Conflicts**: Run `go mod tidy` after each merge
2. **Test Failures**: Fix tests before proceeding
3. **Build Breaks**: Rollback and investigate
4. **Missing Functionality**: Verify all efforts present

### Preventive Measures:
- Always merge with --no-ff for clear history
- Test after each merge, not just at end
- Keep backup branches/tags
- Document any deviations
