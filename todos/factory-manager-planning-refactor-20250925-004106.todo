   - planning/phase1-4/ for phase plans
   - planning/phaseX/waveY/ for wave plans

2. ✅ Moved IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md to planning/project/PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

   - Properly separated from implementation efforts

3. ✅ Updated orchestrator-state.json with planning locations
   - Added metadata_locations section
   - Added planning_files section
   - Updated notes to reflect reorganization

4. ✅ Created efforts directory structure
   - efforts/ for implementation code
   - efforts/.software-factory/ for effort metadata
   - Added README.md explaining the separation

5. ✅ Committed and pushed all changes
   - Commit: 1b12ee55
   - Clean commit with descriptive message
   - Successfully pushed to origin/main

## Result:
Successfully applied new planning file location rules to the idpbuilder project. The project now has proper separation between planning documents (in planning/) and implementation code (in efforts/). The orchestrator-state.json has been updated with all necessary references to prevent agents from looking in wrong locations.
